# EvoSim
EvoSim (Evolution Simulator) was constructed as a final year dissertation project

EvoSim implementes an evolutionary algorithm to generate the morphologies and traits of agents whose objective function is to navigate randomly generated terrain.

EvoSim implements Box2D as a physics engine (library code found under (EvoSim/evolutionsim1/deps/)
The SDL library is used to provide window management
glew is implement for OpenGl, which is used for the graphics rendering
Addditional libraries such as glm are used for simplifying matrix arithmatic
